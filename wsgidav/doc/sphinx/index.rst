Main Features
=============

- Comes bundled with a server and a file system provider, so we can share a
  directory right away from the command line.
- Designed to run behind any WSGI compliant server.
- Tested with different clients on different platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac).
- Supports online editing of MS Office documents.
- Contains a simple web browser interface.
- SSL support
- Support for authentication using Basic or Digest scheme.
- Passes the `litmus test suite <http://www.webdav.org/neon/litmus/>`_.
- Open architecture allows to :doc:`user_guide_custom_providers`
  (i.e. storage, locking, authentication, virtual file systems, ...).
- WsgiDAV is a `refactored version of PyFileServer <https://github.com/mar10/wsgidav/blob/master/doc/changelog04.md>`_
  written by Ho Chun Wei.


.. note::

  Release 3.0 is pretty new and introduces some refactorings and breaking changes. |br|
  Wimps may prefer using 2.x for a more stable release ;-)


Quickstart
==========

Releases are hosted on `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/WsgiDAV>`_.
Install WsgiDAV (and a server) like::

  $ pip install cheroot wsgidav

.. note::
   MS Windows users that only need the command line interface may prefer the
   `MSI installer <https://github.com/mar10/wsgidav/releases>`_.

To serve the ``/tmp`` folder as WebDAV ``/`` share with anonyoums read-write
access, simply run::

  $ wsgidav --host=0.0.0.0 --port=80 --root=/tmp --auth=anonymous

Then open `http://HOST/ <http://localhost/>`_ in your browser or pass this URL to another
WebDAV-aware client, such as MS Word, macOS Finder, Windows File Explorer, ...

**On Linux** we can enforce authentication against known users (e.g.
``/etc/passwd``, ``/etc/shadow``) like so::

  $ wsgidav --host=0.0.0.0 --port=80 --root=/tmp --auth=pam-login

**On Windows** we can enforce authentication against known users (e.g.
Windows NT Domain Controller) like so::

  > wsgidav --host=0.0.0.0 --port=80 --root=/tmp --auth=nt

There is much more to configure. Read this docs to find out.


Supported Clients
=================

WsgiDAV comes with a web interface and was tested with different clients
(Windows File Explorer and drive mapping, MS Office, Ubuntu, Mac OS X, ...).
